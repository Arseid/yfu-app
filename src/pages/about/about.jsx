        Introducing YFu, a game created in 2023 by Ryan Marin and Yves-Robert
        Estrada as part of their development project at Ynov Sophia Campus. The
        name YFu is a combination of the "Y" from Ynov school and the Chinese
        word "Fu," which means luck, while also evoking the term "waifu."
      </p>

      <p>
        YFu is a fashion game where the objective is to win characters and
        clothing to dress them up in cute outfits. Immerse yourself in an
        adorable and retro atmosphere thanks to its pixel art aesthetics.
      </p>

      <p>
        To obtain new items like clothes, you can play mini-games to earn
        tokens. These tokens can then be used in the gacha for random draws,
        offering the chance to win new items.
